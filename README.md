## üîß Setup and Launch

1. **Get the Code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dizzydwarfus/finance-dashboard
   cd finance-dashboard
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **MongoDB Setup**: Ensure MongoDB is active. Update `.env` with your MongoDB details.

4. **Engage with the Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Ticker_List.py
   ```



## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

- **Data Processing:** Pandas
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Database:** pymongo
- **Visualization:** plotly

The main core part of the financial data obtained will be from financial APIs at the beginning to get started but will be transitioned to a self-scraped data from [Data SEC](www.sec.gov) eventually. Several open-source tools/libraries may be used when needed to aid in processing and scraping these data. These tools include but not limited to:

1. Pandas
2. Streamlit
3. pymongo
4. plotly

Streamlit will be used as the main open-source app framework for its ease of implementation. I will try to write the codebase in such a way where migration to other web-frameworks would be possible with minimal effort in the future since Streamlit has its limitation.

Plotly is chosen because it works very well with streamlit as opposed to matplotlib. Plotly also offers highly interactive figures that is much more customizable than matplotlib's.


## üéØ Goal of Project

Besides personal stake in stock/ETF/crypto investing, I have a strong interest for finance. Though not from a Business/Finance educational background, I've self-learned many financial concepts needed to evaluate a company. Merging this knowledge with my passion for programming, I embarked on creating a financial dashboard to aid in investment decisions and to track the financial performance of my investments. While the project can be extensive, my approach is to start simple and iteratively refine and extend its capabilities.


## Action Plan

The development strategy is segmented into:

1. **Data Gathering/Extraction:** Extract data from trusted APIs.
2. **Data Storage:** Store data to a NoSQL database.
3. **Data Cleaning and Processing:** Ensure data quality and transform data as needed.
4. **Data Presentation/Visualization:** Display data in a user-friendly format.
5. **Generate Insights:** Analyze and offer valuable insights based on the data.

## üìù Development Log

Before 2023-05-30

1. Enabled manual update of ticker list if interested ticker symbol is not in the pre-downloaded list.
2. Use st.secrets so usernames, passwords, API-keys are stored as secrets instead of in local/cloud txt files.
3. Selectable plotly charts. Can pick and choose whichever graph to show from a list of key-graphs. 
4. Instead of directly calling API (slow), first storing information in database (<span style="color:#FF0001;">permitted as long as data not used commercially and not redistributed</span>). This is also a workaround for the limited requests per day allowed for using free version of these APIs. 
5. Introduced DCF calculator - with customizable growth, discount rates, market conditions.
6. Published on streamlit community cloud server (free)
7. Cached data whenever possible to reduce load time
